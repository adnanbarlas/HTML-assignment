    <h2>Presidential initiative for artifical intelligence and computing</h2>
    <p>
    Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC) is a privately funded notfor-profit 
    educational initiative started by President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, Kazi Rahat Ali, and Zia Khan to help 
    promote education, research and business opportunities in emerging tech fields like

    </ul>
    <h3 id="CNC">Cloud Native Computing:</h3>
    <p>
    The prepares the students to program in open source technologies like, Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, 
    JavaScript, Node.js, React and React Native while introducing the students to development of 
    Microservices and software development techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.
    </p>
    <h3 id="AI">Artifical Intelligence:</h3>
    <p>
    The artificial intelligence program of PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of the AI technology, 
    via teaching programming in open source languages like Python, Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask,
    and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and ending with real-life examples of modern day AI in 
    practice.
    </p>
    <h3 id="B">Blockchain:</h3>
    <p>
    The main emphasis of Blockchain program is to understand the blockchains like Ethereum and Hyperledger 
    (Fabric), and learn to program in languages such as Solidity, JavaScript on frameworks like Node.js. The 
    program also introduces them to development of Distributed Apps (DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and an 
    in-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-aservice (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) 
    of a crypto-token.
    </p>
    <h3 id="IOT">Internet of Things:</h3>
    <p>
    The program introduces the students to open source development technologies like Rust, 
    Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant, and Kubernetes while making them efficient in 
    developing Micro Services for IoT Edge, IoT Cloud, and voice computing for device control.
